# Eve Hwang

[Schedule a meeting](https://fantastical.app/evehwang) | [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eviehwang) | [GitHub](https://github.com/EvieHwang) | [eve@evehwang.com](mailto:eve@evehwang.com)

Product leader specializing in establishing technical infrastructure for problems at the edge of organizational capability. I find solutions where strategic ambiguity, technical complexity, and organizational dynamics intersect—particularly in supply chain systems, AI implementation, and large-scale operational programs.

## Current Work

> Program scale: 60M+ meals delivered since 2020 | 50+ food bank partnerships | Multi-year executive commitment through 2028

At Amazon, establishing foundational infrastructure for the Community Delivery program—an international-scale initiative providing free home delivery from food banks to families facing food insecurity. Responsible for architecting systems that enable 60+ food bank partners to operate at scale while integrating with Amazon's logistics network.

To support the work, I built an AI assistant contextualized with complete program knowledge, capable of generating SQL for operational analytics and statistical insights. I am also a member of Amazon's Community Impact AI Working Group, exploring generative AI applications for community impact missions.

## Technical Research: AI in Supply Chain

Investigating generative AI applications for catalog data augmentation and backfilling—a problem that exists across every supply chain operation but lacks established solution patterns. My [Weight & Measure](https://github.com/EvieHwang/wm2) project serves as research infrastructure: demonstrating tool use, semantic search via RAG, multi-agent workflows, and integration patterns with existing systems.

### Core Capabilities

- Architecting agentic AI systems and multi-agent orchestration for production environments
- Developing AI evaluation methodologies for production systems—particularly for use cases where traditional metrics don't apply
- Implementing RAG systems and semantic search for operational contexts
- Building automation infrastructure with API-accessible tools (MCP, AWS Lambda, serverless architectures)

## Strategic Approach

I operate where three types of complexity intersect: organizational dynamics that make alignment difficult, technical systems that require deep understanding, and strategic ambiguity where the path forward isn't clear. My differentiator is the ability to move fluently across all three—reading the code, understanding the architecture, navigating organizational relationships, and making supported judgments at every level.

## Background

Previously operationalized demand forecasting systems, developed fraud and loss detection capabilities, and built supply chain buffering mechanisms. Experience includes work across Nordstrom's supply chain systems and Slalom's enterprise product portfolio.

## Community Leadership

Board member and former Chair (2023-24) of the GSBA, Washington's LGBTQ+ and Allied Chamber of Commerce serving 1,400+ small businesses. Contributed to the organization receiving the national NGLCC Chamber of the Year 2024 award.
